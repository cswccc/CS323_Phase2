| **Type 2**  | a function is invoked without a definition                   | Finish   |
| **Type 3**  | a variable is redefined in the same scope                    | Finish   |
| **Type 4**  | a function is redefined (in the global scope, since we don’t have nested functions) | Finish   |
| **Type 5**  | unmatching types appear at both sides of the assignment operator (=) |          |
| **Type 6**  | rvalue appears on the left-hand side of the assignment operator |          |
| **Type 7**  | unmatching operands, such as adding an integer to a structure variable |          |
| **Type 8**  | a function’s return value type mismatches the declared type  |          |
| **Type 9**  | a function’s arguments mismatch the declared parameters (either types or numbers, or both) |          |
| **Type 10** | applying indexing operator ([…]) on non-array type variables |          |
| **Type 11** | applying function invocation operator (foo(…)) on non-function names |          |
| **Type 12** | array indexing with a non-integer type expression            |          |
| **Type 13** | accessing members of a non-structure variable (i.e., misuse the dot operator) |          |
